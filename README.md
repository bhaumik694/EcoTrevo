# ✈️ SkyTrace — Flight Explorer & Carbon Footprint Calculator

> A travel web app where users can search for flights between global airports, pick travel dates, and calculate the CO₂ emissions of their journey — built for a hackathon to blend travel exploration with environmental awareness.

---

## 📌 Description

**SkyTrace** is a React-based travel application that puts two powerful ideas together: the joy of exploring the world, and the responsibility of understanding your environmental impact. Users land on a cinematic, full-screen flight search interface where they can select departure and destination airports from 50+ global options, pick travel dates, and hit "Book Now". The **Carbon Footprint Calculator** then lets them estimate CO₂ emissions per passenger based on distance, travel class, and trip type — turning every booking decision into an informed one.

## ✨ Features

- 🌍 **Cinematic Home Page** — Full-screen auto-scrolling image carousel with glassmorphism UI overlay
- 🛫 **Flight Search** — From/To airport selector with 50+ airports across India, USA, UK, Europe, Middle East, Asia, Africa, and more
- 📅 **Date Picker with Validation** — Smart date inputs that reject past dates and invalid ranges with toast notifications
- 🧮 **Carbon Footprint Calculator** — Real CO₂ estimates using ICAO-standard emission factors based on:
  - Distance (short / medium / long-haul rates)
  - Travel class (Economy → First Class multipliers)
  - One-way or Round Trip
  - Number of passengers
- 🌱 **Eco Insights** — Translates CO₂ into trees needed, driving equivalent, and energy consumption
- 🔐 **Authentication** — Signup and Login pages with smooth navigation
- 📱 **Responsive Design** — Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern UI

## 🧮 How Carbon Calculation Works

The calculator uses the **Haversine formula** to compute the great-circle distance between two airports using their coordinates, then applies ICAO-standard emission factors:

| Haul Type | Distance | kg CO₂ per km |
|---|---|---|
| Short-haul | < 1,500 km | 0.255 |
| Medium-haul | 1,500 – 4,000 km | 0.195 |
| Long-haul | > 4,000 km | 0.147 |

**Class multipliers** (relative to Economy):
- Economy: ×1.0
- Premium Economy: ×1.6
- Business: ×2.9
- First Class: ×4.0

## 🌱 Why This Matters

Aviation accounts for roughly 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions. Most travelers have no idea what their flight costs the planet. This app puts that number right in front of you — so you can fly informed, and maybe fly a little less.
